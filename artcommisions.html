        <h1>Art Commission Rules</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my art commission page! Here are the rules you need to follow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All commissions are free for you to use as you see fit; but credit is appreciated if you post on IG or Threads. See <a href="index.html">the main page</a> for my socials. Mentions on Discord should use @silent.</li>
            <li>AI remakes of my art are okay, but be sure to credit me as the original artist.</li>
            <li>Payment must be made upfront.</li>
            <li>Refunds are accepted up until the finished art is delivered.</li>
            <li>Turnaround could be two to three days, depending on the complexity of the piece, my life, and my ADHD focus.</li>
            <li>I'd like to change my art if it's not up to your standards, but please do be mindful of my time and not too demanding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!</p>
